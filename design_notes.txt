Design notes:


- Accepts CLI inputs for installer location, app label, install directory, dry-run, uninstall, and log path for flexible automation.

- Checks installer file existence and size before running to prevent unnecessary failures.

- Executes the .sh installer silently via environment variables; falls back to simulated install only if real install fails.

- Supports uninstall to clean the install directory, enabling repeatable and idempotent runs.

- Logs all steps with timestamps, command outputs, and produces a JSON summary with detailed run information.

- Uses specific exit codes for success, download failure, install failure, validation failure, and exceptions to communicate outcome clearly.

- Adds unique timestamps to log and summary filenames to avoid overwriting and to improve traceability.
